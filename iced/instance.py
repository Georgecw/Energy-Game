-----------
The implement of a game instance in the game.

A game instance is an instance of a game object, like a
variable of a class in Python. A game instance is an
independent copy of the object, and that means every
instances should not make a difference on the code
by game functions themselves. And also, it is what the
player actually see and interact with in the game.

To create an instance, you should send the object you wish
to be instantiated and the position x and y.

For more, see the documentation.
