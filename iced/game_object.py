--------------
The implement of the objects in the game.

The game object is the minimum unit to define a interactive
object in a game, e.g. a block, a road, a character, etc.

In Structure Iced, you can easily define an object by
simply inherit the class game_object. A game object
requires the arguments in the following text:

1. An image (which will be showed when game begins)
2. A creation function (To note what the function should do
                        when it is being created)
3. A loop function (To note what the function should do
                    every game loop)
4. A destroying function (The one when it is being
                          destroyed)

For more, see the documentation.
